                I put my deployed projects on this page
                <h3><a href="http://www.phuongtran.me/drawing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <br><u>Simple
                    Drawing Tool</u></a> </h3>
                <h4>Use cases:</h4>
                During my last quarters as a senior at University of Washington in Seattle, Washington, I had difficult
                time to explain class materials over the phone with a friend since she can't visualize what I had in my head.
                Therefore, I created this app that allow users interact on the same drawing canvas in real time.<br><br>
                <h4>How it works:</h4>
                A user (host) can let other users draw on his/her canvas by clicking on "Share your canvas" button.
                This action would generate a random code. I did not store any generated codes, so I can't check the
                uniqueness of them, and therefore, there is a chance that the code is being used by someone else.
                However, this probability is small since the length of a code is 6 digits.
                Other users (guests) enter the code into their "Room #" textbox and click on "Join canvas by entering a room code" button.
                A room code acts like a channel in Socket.IO which is introduced below. <br>

                I picked <a href="https://socket.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Socket.IO</a> to act like a middleman
                on server side to deliver messages between users. Socket.IO uses publish/subscribe pattern, please
                go to this <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern#:~:text=In%20software%20architecture%2C%20publish%E2%80%93subscribe,if%20any%2C%20there%20may%20be." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> wiki </a>
                page to understand how this pattern works. When the host finished drawing a line, a message containing info about that line as well as
                the room code created by the host sent to server. At server, Socket.IO uses the room code as a channel and forwards the message to guests via
                that channel. Any guests who subcribe to that channel will receive the message. As a result, the line is drawn on guests' canvas.
                Similarly, if a guest made any drawings, these would also be displayed on the host's canvas.<br>
                A segment drawn on canvas is not straight line. It connects all of straight lines. To reduce the number of straight lines,
                <a href="http://paperjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paperjs</a> is in use to smooth the segment.<br><br>
                <h4>Future Functionality:</h4>
                <u><b>Room code Validation:</b></u> when a user entered a room code and click on "Join canvas by entering a room code" button, an alert would show up. Currently, this alert is meaningless. In the future,
                This alert will tell the user whether a code is valid. The code is valid if and only if there is at least one other user using the code.
